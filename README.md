# bookStoreManagement
Maven Spring Boot REST API Spring MVC ThymeLeaf

Requirements:
1. Maven Project using Spring Initializer: Start by setting up a Maven project via the 
Spring Initializer. This will ensure that all required dependencies and plugins are set up 
properly.
2. Spring Boot REST API: Develop a RESTful API using Spring Boot that will handle all 
CRUD operations related to books, such as adding a new book, fetching details of a book, 
updating book details, and deleting a book.
3. Connection to a Database: Connect your application to a database (e.g., MySQL or 
PostgreSQL) where all the book details will be stored. Implement CRUD operations to 
manage the book inventory.
4. Spring MVC for the Backend: Implement the backend logic using Spring MVC. This 
should manage request mappings, handle responses, and integrate with the database.
5. ThymeLeaf, CSS, and Bootstrap for the Frontend:
o Design a frontend that allows staff to manage the inventory and customers to 
browse the books.
o Use ThymeLeaf as the template engine to display the book data fetched from the 
backend.
o Incorporate CSS for styling and Bootstrap to ensure the website is responsive and 
has a modern design.
6. Spring Security:
o Implement a login form for the bookstore staff and customers.
o Include a logout button to ensure users can log out securely.
o Set up role-based controls: Staff should have permissions to add, update, or delete 
books, while customers should only be able to browse and make purchase requests.
o Use JDBC authentication to verify user credentials against the database.
o Implement password security using the bcrypt algorithm.
o Create a custom access denied page for users trying to access unauthorized sections.
7. DevTools and Actuator Dependencies: Integrate Spring Boot DevTools to ensure faster 
development cycles by automatically restarting the application upon changes. Use the 
Actuator dependency to gain insights into the applicationâ€™s health, metrics, and other 
details.
